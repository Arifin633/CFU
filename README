This is a port of "Chad's Furniture" mod
to Terraria 1.4.3.6 (tModLoader 0.12 Alpha).

It features an entire rewrite of the codebase, and thus the
performance pitfalls of the original mod have not carried over.
This version also seeks to bring all items and textures up to
date with 1.4; one example of this being the place-able ambient
objects, which have been brought in sync with their 1.4 vanilla
counterparts.

For all the additions of the original mod, consult the now inactive homepage:

the updated version.  They may or may not be added in the future.

* Carpets
