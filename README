This is a port of "Chad's Furniture" mod to Terraria 1.4.4.

It features an entire rewrite of the codebase, and thus the
performance pitfalls of the original mod have not carried over.
This version also seeks to bring all items and textures up to
date with modern Terraria; new furniture sets have been added
(such as Ashwood) and all vanilla texture changes since the
original mod was released have been reflected on the mod's
own textures.

For all the additions of the original mod, consult the now inactive homepage:

The following list contains the main features
and changes not included in the original:

* Rubblemaker 2.0
An improved version of vanilla's Rubblemaker that allows
the player to place pots, stalagmites, and stalactites.

* Magic Seed Bag
Another Rubblemaker-type item that allows the player
to place every type of plant, including vines.
These plants are not destroyed by attacks
and thus can safely be used when building.

* Carpets
Not implemented.

* Vanilla Background Walls & Objects
Not implemented (already added by vanilla).

Fixes and basic improvements are not listed.
