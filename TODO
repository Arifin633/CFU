This file includes planned additions, improvements and changes.
The TODO file from the original Chad's Furniture is attached at the bottom.

* Biome Jars
Add more biomes.
Current ones: Forest, Hallow, Corruption, Crimson, Jungle.

* Giant Water Fountain
The water texture for this fountain doesn't match the style of other fountains
because of its dark outline.  The texture should be re-touched.

* Mirrors
Add one for each furniture type.
Current ones: Wood, Boreal Wood, Palm Wood, Rich Mahogany, Shade Wood, Ebonwood,
Pearlwood, Princess.

* Chess Pieces
Add directional placement for Bishops and Knights,
as the textures are already there.

* Doors
In vanilla, doors will attempt to open towards the opposite direction the player
is facing if the preferred direction is obstructed.  This behavior should be
added to modded doors.

* Dressers
Highlight is broken -- only the top is highlighted, and I have no idea why.

* Wall Candelabras
Add missing furniture types: Spider, Sandstone, Bamboo, Lesion, Lunar stuff.

* Items
The following item textures don't match the corresponding tile:
Bottle; all Mirrors; Mystic Bookcase; Mystic Bed; Mystic Clock;
Mystic Wall Clock; Princess Bed; Princess Bookcase; Princess Chair;
Princess Wall Clock; all Wardrobes. (This list might be outdated)

Aside from that, a lot of other item textures are just plain bad and/or don't
match the game's style very well.

* Tiles
The dust and sound of pretty much every tile is wrong.
Additionally, their map color is often inaccurate, specially
when it comes to tiles with a lot of different styles.

* Wall Clocks
* Wall Candelabras
* Wardrobes
* Mirrors
* Cabinets
These tiles' textures are supposed to be based on their vanilla equivalents,
but some are mismatched, either because of a mistake when they were first
made or because the vanilla textures have been updated since then.

* Miracle Plants
The item textures for all plants look specially
bad as they are just copy and pasted tiles.

* Miracle Lily Pads
Both placement and killing of the tile is very finicky.
The lily pad will get stuck in place (either underwater or hovering in the air)
if the water gets too high/low.  Some mechanism should be put in place so
the tile can physically change its position in that situation.

* Mannequin Head
Add hair-displaying capabilities as it had in the original mod.

* Wall Clocks
Draw the pendulum using `AddSpecialPosition' to avoid blurriness.

* Wall Candelabras
Use vanilla values for the light colors and flame draw data.

* Cabinets
No highlighting.

* Paintable Sofa
* Paintable Armchair
Highlighting gets hidden under the wooden parts.

* Walls
All walls have the same map color.

* Potted Plants
The potted plants are good candidates to join the
ranks of tiles affected by wind.  That would require
a system for drawing the pots themselves, as the
plants would overlap with them otherwise.

* Rabbit Hole
The rabbit hole should "display" a rabbit,
much like critter cages and the Birdhouses.

* Birdhouses
Birds will instantly appear on the birdhouses, and will never leave.
Animations of the birds flying to and from the birdhouses should
be put together.  This animation could show the bird going into/
coming from the horizon, to minize the need to draw an animation
far away from the birdhouse.

The coming and going of birds should also be tied to certain conditions
as opposed to being purely random like the rest of the animation frames.
These conditions could include: Only come in if the path isn't obstructed
by walls or solid tiles; fly away at night, or if the player gets too close.

* Ornaments
Originally, the ornaments "blended" with any solid tile placed below them.
