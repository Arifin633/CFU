This file includes both known bugs and planned additions.
The TODO file from the original Chad's Furniture is attached at the bottom.

* Lanterns
* Banners
Add animation on touch.

* Biome jars
Drops two items(?).
Add more biomes.
Current ones: Forest, Hallow, Corruption, Crimson, Jungle.

* Giant water fountain
The water texture doesn't match the style of other fountains' water.

* Ink
Either associate this with the vanilla Black Ink item, or make a new one.

* Mirrors
Add one for each furniture type,
Current ones: Wood, Boreal Wood, Palm Wood, Rich Mahogany, Shade Wood, Ebonwood,
Pearlwood, Princess.

* Chess Pieces
No directional placement on Bishop and Knight.

* Doors
In vanilla, doors will attempt to open towards the opposite direction the player
is facing if the preferred direction is obstructed.  This behavior should be
added the modded doors.

* Sofa
Can't sit on the center.

* End Tables
Royal and Rush end tables can't be stood on.
This is because they occupy the second row of styles in the texture file, and
only the first row is capable of having a solid top.  No idea how to fix this.

* Wall Clocks
No highlight textures.

* Dressers
Highlight is broken.

* End Tables
* Wall Candelabras
Add missing furniture types: Spider, Sandstone, Bamboo,  Lesion, Lunar stuff.

* Items
The following item textures don't match the corresponding tile:
Bottle; all Mirrors; Mystic Bookcase; Mystic Bed; Mystic Clock;
Mystic Wall Clock; Princess Bed; Princess Bookcase; Princess Chair;
Princess Wall Clock.

Aside from that, a lot of other item textures are just plain bad and/or don't
match the game's style very well.

* Dressers
* Chests
Renaming a modded chest or dresser to "" will not restore its default name.
