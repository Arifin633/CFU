This file includes planned additions, improvements and changes.
The TODO file from the original Chad's Furniture is attached at the bottom.

* Biome Jars
Add more biomes.
Current ones: Forest, Hallow, Corruption, Crimson, Jungle.

* Giant Water Fountain
The water texture for this fountain doesn't match the style of other fountains
because of its dark outline.  The texture should be re-touched.

* Ink
Associate this with the vanilla Black Ink item.

* Mirrors
Add one for each furniture type.
Current ones: Wood, Boreal Wood, Palm Wood, Rich Mahogany, Shade Wood, Ebonwood,
Pearlwood, Princess.

* Chess Pieces
Add directional placement for Bishops and Knights,
as the textures are already there.

* Doors
In vanilla, doors will attempt to open towards the opposite direction the player
is facing if the preferred direction is obstructed.  This behavior should be
added to modded doors.

* Thrones
* Poufs
* Sofas
The sitting positions aren't very accurate.
`TileRestingInfo.visualOffset' can be used to make adjustments.

* Dressers
Highlight is broken -- only the top is highlighted, and I have no idea why.

* End Tables
* Wall Candelabras
Add missing furniture types: Spider, Sandstone, Bamboo, Lesion, Lunar stuff.

* Items
The following item textures don't match the corresponding tile:
Bottle; all Mirrors; Mystic Bookcase; Mystic Bed; Mystic Clock;
Mystic Wall Clock; Princess Bed; Princess Bookcase; Princess Chair;
Princess Wall Clock; all Wardrobes. (This list might be outdated)

Aside from that, a lot of other item textures are just plain bad and/or don't
match the game's style very well.

* Tiles
The dust and sound of pretty much every tile is wrong.
Additionally, their map color is often inaccurate, specially
when it comes to tiles with a lot of different styles.

* Wall Clocks
* Wall Candelabras
* Wardrobes
* Mirrors
* End Tables
* Cabinets
These tiles' textures are supposed to be based on their vanilla equivalents,
but some are mismatched, either because of a mistake when they were first
made or because the vanilla textures have been updated since then.

* Miracle Plants
The item textures for all plants look specially
bad as they are just copy and pasted tiles.

* Miracle Lily Pads
Both placement and killing of the tile is very finicky.
The lily pad will get stuck in place (either underwater or hovering in the air)
if the water gets too high/low.  Some mechanism should be put in place so
the tile can physically change its position in that situation.

* Mannequin Head
Add hair-displaying capabilities as it had in the original mod.

* Wall Clocks
Draw the pendulum using `AddSpecialPosition' to avoid blurriness.

* Wall Candelabras
Use vanilla values for the light colors and flame draw data.

* Cabinets
No highlighting.

* Paintable Sofa
* Paintable Armchair
Highlighting gets hidden under the wooden parts.

* Walls
All walls have the same map color.

* Potted Plants
The potted plants are good candidates to join the
ranks of tiles affected by wind.  That would require
a system for drawing the pots themselves, as the
plants would overlap with them otherwise.

* Birdhouses
* Rabbit Hole
These tiles ought to spawn their respective NPCs as they originally did.
I don't know if there was a problem in the porting process or if they never
made much sense in the first place, but the original NPC AI isn't much of
an improvement over having nothing at all, so a new one will have to be
written from scratch, which is a significant undertaking.

An alternative to spawning NPCs at all is to instead use animations built
into the birdhouses/rabbit holes, much like critter cages work.  This is a
much simpler (even if still not simple) solution, but also an inferior one
as birds/rabbits will be limited to a small area, and their movement won't
be as smooth.

* Ornaments
Originally, the ornaments "blended" with any solid tile placed below them.
