This file includes both known bugs and planned additions.
The TODO file from the original Chad's Furniture is attached at the bottom.

* Biome Jars
Add more biomes.
Current ones: Forest, Hallow, Corruption, Crimson, Jungle.

* Giant water fountain
The water texture doesn't match the style of other fountains' water.

* Ink
Either associate this with the vanilla Black Ink item, or make a new one.

* Mirrors
Add one for each furniture type,
Current ones: Wood, Boreal Wood, Palm Wood, Rich Mahogany, Shade Wood, Ebonwood,
Pearlwood, Princess.

* Chess Pieces
No directional placement on Bishop and Knight.

* Doors
In vanilla, doors will attempt to open towards the opposite direction the player
is facing if the preferred direction is obstructed.  This behavior should be
added the modded doors.

* Thrones
* Poufs
* Sofas
The sitting positions aren't very good, TileRestingInfo.visualOffset can be used
to make adjustments.

* End Tables
Royal and Rush end tables can't be stood on.
This is because they occupy the second row of styles in the texture file, and
only the first row is capable of having a solid top.  No idea how to fix this.

* Dressers
Highlight is broken.

* End Tables
* Wall Candelabras
Add missing furniture types: Spider, Sandstone, Bamboo, Lesion, Lunar stuff.

* Items
The following item textures don't match the corresponding tile:
Bottle; all Mirrors; Mystic Bookcase; Mystic Bed; Mystic Clock;
Mystic Wall Clock; Princess Bed; Princess Bookcase; Princess Chair;
Princess Wall Clock; all Wardrobes.

Aside from that, a lot of other item textures are just plain bad and/or don't
match the game's style very well.

The dust and sound of pretty much every item is wrong.

* Wall Clocks
* Wall Candelabras
* Wardrobes
* Mirrors
* End Tables
* Cabinets
These tiles' textures are supposed to be based on their vanilla equivalents,
but some are mismatched, either because of a mistake when they were first
made or because the vanilla textures have been updated since then.

* Miracle Plants
The item textures for all plants look specially
bad as they are just copy and pasted tiles.

* Miracle Lily Pads
Both placement and killing of the tile is very finicky.
The lily pad will get stuck in place (either underwater or hovering in the air)
if the water gets too high/low.  Some mechanism should be put in place so
tile can physically change its position in that situation.

* Miracle Vines
Can't be placed (extended) unless there's a wall or another solid block.
Doesn't get killed if the tile above it is.

* Mannequin Head
Add hair-displaying capabilities as it had in the original mod.

* Wall Clocks
Draw the pendulum using `AddSpecialPosition' to avoid blurriness.

* Wall Candelabras
Use vanilla values for the light colors and flame draw data.

* Cabinets
No highlighting.
